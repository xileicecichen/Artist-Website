                Dear Mom,<br />

                I miss you a lot. It’s been 200 days since I left home.<br />
                <br />
                Since I was very young, I’ve always wanted to escape. Trained in silence, shaped by meritocracy, I longed to break free. Even though you and Dad insisted I didn’t need to be outstanding, I didn’t believe you. Criticism from you and dad taught me otherwise. When I tried to speak up, you said, “It’s our first time being parents — of course we’ll make mistakes.” So I stayed silent. But Mom, it was also my first time being a child. And I wanted to run away. I wanted to leave home. <br />
                <br />
                So I left the moment I could. <br />
                <br />
                I had been silent for too long. I didn’t want to be obedient anymore. I didn’t want to become the person society had programmed me to be. I wanted to be the bad child.<br />
                <br />
                I searched for those who defied the norm — women who didn’t fit the mold of the “good woman” society has always expected. I documented them. I wondered: if I collect enough stories of them, can I piece together a blueprint for the life I want to live? I mimicked them. If I embody enough of them, can I become the kind of bad child I’ve always secretly longed to be?<br />
                <br />
                I met many of these women. They were kind. They changed me.<br />
                One of them told me: “Resist them. Don’t grow up the way they want you to. Don’t get married just because it’s time. We are children of the universe.”<br />
                She said, “Let’s marry the planet instead.”<br />
                We wore veils, like the women of old who chose independence over tradition. I took my very first wedding photo — with myself. And then we took many more.<br />
                For a moment, I thought maybe, just maybe, I had succeeded in escaping.<br />
                Then you called me before the New Year.<br />
                You told me Dad had been cheating on you for years.<br />
                It was like a drop of water falling into a still lake — the kind of silence that echoes forever.<br />
                <br />
                You said, “You’re all I have. I don’t have parents. You’re my only family.”<br />
                So you confided in me.<br />
                But Mom, I couldn’t hold your pain.<br />
                <br />
                You told me you endured all these years for me — that your suffering was because of me.<br />
                And I was left drowning in guilt, simply for existing.<br />
                How am I supposed to face Dad?<br />
                <br />
                When you cried to me, I could only stay silent — because I was already falling apart.<br />
                We hurt each other so much.<br />
                We love each other deeply. But why is love so often the weapon we use against each other?<br />
                <br />
                You once told me about gu bao — the Cantonese method of binding broken clay pots with iron hoops. But as I put metals between layers of clays, they didn’t stay together as the old method tells. And the harder we try to staple the layers together, the more they tear apart as the clay dries.<br />
                Later, Dad had heart surgery and didn’t tell me.<br />
                The rest of the family said I wasn’t filial enough.<br />
                But what should I do?<br />
                How am I supposed to love him?<br />
                How am I supposed to hate him?<br />
                I’m overwhelmed.<br />
                <br />
                Love. Hate. Life. Death.<br />
                They’re all wrapped tightly around me like threads I can’t untangle.<br />
                <br />
                What if one of you dies before I figure out how to face any of this?<br />
                Will you be buried in one of those cold, desolate cemeteries — the kind that only sees three cars and five people pass by in a month?<br />
                <br />
                Mom, I’ve come to realize I may never truly escape.<br />
                Eighteen years of living at home means I carry your gaze inside me wherever I go.<br />
                A huge part of me has already been permanently reshaped by you and Dad,<br />
                forever reminding me of where I came from.<br />
                <br />
                Mom, why am I here?<br />
                After all that struggle to run away and, to hide, am I destined to fall into the same nostalgia and homesickness as everyone else?<br />
                <br />
                To long for the very childhood I once tried so hard to escape?<br />
                <br />
                And yet, Mom —<br />
                I love you.<br />
                <br />
                Like every other asian kid, I almost never say “I love you”.<br />
                Instead, I asked you to witnes in my marriage. You stood behind the camera, photographing me in a veil, in the place where I first learned the shape of the world.<br />
                I’m sorry, mom.<br />
                I'm so clumsy with love that even my art cannot say it; it only maps the knots and bruises of the bond between us.<br />
                I am the coward in love, only have the courage to speak about my love in a language you don’t even understand.<br />
                <br />
                But Mom, I love you.<br />
                I miss home.<br />
                I miss you.<br />
